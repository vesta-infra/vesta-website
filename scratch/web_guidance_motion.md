# Add entry and exit effects to elements as they enter or exit the scrollport

Entry and exit effects are animations that are triggered when an element enters or leaves the viewport. This can be used to create engaging and dynamic user experiences. For example, you can use an entry effect to fade in an element as it scrolls into view, or an exit effect to scale it down as it scrolls out of view.

## How to implement

To add entry and exit effects to an element, you need to combine a few CSS properties. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1.  **Create separate `@keyframes` for the entry and exit animations.** The entry animation will be applied as the element enters the viewport, and the exit animation will be applied as it leaves.

    ```css
    @keyframes slide-in {
      from { transform: translateX(-100%); }
    }
    @keyframes slide-out {
      to { transform: translateX(100%); }
    }
    ```

2.  **Attach the entry and exit keyframes to the element.** You can do this by defining multiple animations in the `animation` property.

    -   Give the entry animation an `animation-fill-mode` of `backwards` so that it applies its initial state before the animation starts.
    -   Give the exit animation an `animation-fill-mode` of `forwards` so that it maintains its final state after the animation is complete.

    ```css
    .animated-element {
      animation:
        slide-in 1s linear backwards,
        slide-out 1s linear forwards;
    }
    ```

3.  **Create a View Timeline and link it to the animations.** A View Timeline is a type of timeline that is linked to the visibility of an element in the viewport. You can create one using the `view()` function and then apply it to your animations using the `animation-timeline` property.

    ```css
    .animated-element {
      animation-timeline: view();
    }
    ```

    By default, `view()` tracks the element on the `block` axis. If you need to track it on the `inline` axis, you can use `view(inline)`.

4.  **Limit the animations to the `entry` and `exit` ranges.** The `animation-range` property allows you to specify which part of the timeline an animation should run on.

    -   The `entry` range covers the time from when the element first enters the viewport until it is fully visible.
    -   The `exit` range covers the time from when the element starts to leave the viewport until it is completely hidden.

    ```css
    .animated-element {
      animation-range: entry, exit;
    }
    ```

## Example code

This code animates the direct children of the scroller on scroll using an **anonymous view-timeline**:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  @supports ((animation-timeline: view()) and (animation-range: entry)) {
    @keyframes grow {
      from {
        scale: 0.5;
      }
    }
    @keyframes shrink {
      to {
        scale: 0.5;
      }
    }

    .scroller > * {
      animation:
        grow auto linear backwards,
        shrink auto linear forwards;
      animation-timeline: view(inline);
      animation-range: entry, exit;
    }
  }
}
```

As the elements enter the scrollport the `grow` animation is played, and as they leave the scrollport the `shrink` animation is played.

The following code has the same visual outcome, but animates the direct children of the scroller on scroll using an **named view-timeline**:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  @supports ((animation-timeline: view()) and (animation-range: entry)) {
    @keyframes grow {
      from {
        scale: 0.5;
      }
    }
    @keyframes shrink {
      to {
        scale: 0.5;
      }
    }

    .scroller > * {
      view-timeline: --tl inline;
      animation:
        grow auto linear backwards,
        shrink auto linear forwards;
      animation-timeline: --tl;
      animation-range: entry, exit;
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

When using scroll-driven animations, it's important to follow a few best practices to ensure a smooth and accessible experience:

- **DO** include feature detection: Not all browsers support scroll-driven animations. Use `@supports ((animation-timeline: view()) and (animation-range: entry))` to check for support and provide a fallback for browsers that don't support it.
  - The `(animation-range: entry)` check **MUST** be included here, to filter out browsers with only partial support.
  - **DO NOT** use the `scroll-timeline-polyfill` package for the fallback strategy as it is not feature complete and has a lot of known issues.
  - If the animation is only considered to be decorative, opt for Progressive Enhancement and **DO NOT** provide a fallback.
- **DO** respect user preferences: Some users prefer to have less motion on the web. Use the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to disable or reduce your animations for these users.
- **DO** try to animate only performant CSS properties: For the smoothest animations, stick to animating properties that can be handled by the browser's compositor thread, such as `transform` and `opacity`. Animating other properties like `width` or `height` can lead to performance issues.
- **DO** use the correct declaration order: When using the `animation` shorthand property, declare `animation-timeline` *after* it to prevent the shorthand from resetting the timeline.

When using the `view()` function to create a scroll-driven animation:

- **OPTIONAL** be explicit about the axis to track: When not targeting the default `block` axis (such as in a horizontal scroller), be explicit about which axis to track with `view(block)` or `view(inline)`.
- When the animation is not applied to the tracked subject itself, use a named view timeline.

When using the `view-timeline` property to create a scroll-driven animation:

- **DO** use a CSS `<dashed-ident>` for the name.
- **OPTIONAL** be explicit about the axis to track: When not targeting the default `block` axis (such as in a horizontal scroller), be explicit about which axis to track with `view-timeline-axis`.
- **DO** make sure the scope of the lookup works: When the element that is declaring the `view-timeline` is not a flat tree ancestor of the animated element, hoist up the visibility of the `view-timeline`’s name by using `timeline-scope` on a shared ancestor.

Prefer a named `view-timeline` when multiple elements or children of the tracked subject need to animate.

## Browser support and fallback strategies

Scroll-driven animations has limited availability.
Supported by: Chrome 115 (Jul 2023), Edge 115 (Jul 2023), and Safari 26 (Sep 2025).
Unsupported in: Firefox.. Therefore, a fallback strategy is typically required.

For browsers that do not support scroll-driven animations, you can use a fallback to recreate the visual effects. The fallbacks are typically built with either a scroll listener (for ScrollTimeline effects) or the IntersectionObserver API (for ViewTimeline effects).

In browsers with built-in support for scroll-driven animations, ALWAYS use the native CSS implementation as those are more performant.

Note that not every effect can be recreated using the fallbacks approach.

For this use-case specifically, the following script applies the fallback for browsers that do not support scroll-driven animations. It uses an `IntersectionObserver` to track the visibility of the `.wrapper` element and updates the `transform` property of the layers based on the scroll position.

```html
<script>
  if (!CSS.supports('(animation-timeline: view()) and (animation-range: entry)')) {
    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
      (entries) => {
        for (const entry of entries) {
          // This matches the effect as defined in the CSS example above.
          // Customize this further if needed.
          entry.target.style.scale = 0.5 + entry.intersectionRatio * 0.5;
        }
      },
      {
        threshold: Array.from({ length: 101 }, (_, i) => i / 100),
      }
    );

    document.querySelectorAll('.scroller > *').forEach((el) => {
      observer.observe(el);
    });
  }
</script>
```


--- Guide for directional-navigation-transitions ---
Single Page Applications (SPAs) provide the appearance of navigation by replacing the content of the page without navigating to a new page. By default, the content is simply replaced, without any transitions. Directional transitions can visually reinforce a spatial relationship between views. 

By sliding new content in from the direction the user is moving you create a mental map of the application structure. For instance, a product site may show a transition to the right for "forward," and to the left for "back", or a slideshow may transition up and down to show next and previous slides.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Detect Navigation Direction**: Determine if the user is moving "forward" or "backward" in the application flow. How you detect the direction depends on your use case.
2. **Trigger Transition with Types**: Pass the direction in a `types` array to `document.startViewTransition()` to categorize the transition.
3. **Define Directional Animations with CSS**: Use the `:active-view-transition-type()` pseudo-class to apply specific animations based on the navigation type.

### Defining Keyframes

Define sliding animations to and from each direction. For best performance, animate position changes using the `transform` property or the individual transform properties, `scale`, `rotate`, and `translate`. `opacity` is generally performant as well, but avoid animating other CSS properties without first verifying that they don't trigger layout or painting.

```css
/* Slide an element out to the left */
@keyframes slide-to-left {
  /* Mandatory: animate `transform` instead of inset properties for better performance. */
  to { transform: translateX(-100%); }
}

/* Slide an element in from the right */
@keyframes slide-from-right {
  from { transform: translateX(100%); }
}

/* Slide an element out to the right */
@keyframes slide-to-right {
  to { transform: translateX(100%); }
}

/* Slide an element in from the left */
@keyframes slide-from-left {
  from { transform: translateX(-100%); }
}
```

### Set up shared animation settings

Use the `::view-transition-group(root)` selector to apply animation settings that are shared across all transitions.

```css
::view-transition-group(root){
  animation: 0.4s ease-in-out both;
}
```

### Applying Directional Animations

Use the `active-view-transition-type` pseudo-class to target the transition views specifically when the "forward" or "backward" type is active.

```css
/* MANDATORY: Apply forward animations when the 'forward' type is active */
html:active-view-transition-type(forward)::view-transition-old(root) {
  animation-name: slide-to-left;
}
html:active-view-transition-type(forward)::view-transition-new(root) {
  animation-name: slide-from-right;
}

/* MANDATORY: Apply backward animations when the 'backward' type is active */
html:active-view-transition-type(backward)::view-transition-old(root) {
  animation-name: slide-to-right;
}
html:active-view-transition-type(backward)::view-transition-new(root) {
  animation-name: slide-from-left;
}
```

### Triggering the Transition

When navigating, pass the appropriate type to the `startViewTransition` method.

```javascript
const transitionType = yourTransitionTypeLogic();
const updateDOM = yourUpdateDOMLogic();

document.startViewTransition({
  update: updateDOM,
  types: [transitionType] // Matches the CSS :active-view-transition-type() selectors
});
```


### Accessibility

Always respect user preferences for reduced motion by disabling or simplifying animations.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  ::view-transition-group(root) {
    animation: none !important;
  }
}
```

### Fallback strategies

Baseline status for View transitions: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2025-10-14.
Supported by: Chrome 111 (Mar 2023), Edge 111 (Mar 2023), Firefox 144 (Oct 2025), and Safari 18 (Sep 2024).
Baseline status for Active view transition: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2026-01-13.
Supported by: Chrome 125 (May 2024), Edge 125 (May 2024), Firefox 147 (Jan 2026), and Safari 18.2 (Dec 2024).

The View Transitions API is a progressive enhancement. In unsupported browsers, `document.startViewTransition` will be `undefined`. You must wrap your navigation logic in a feature detection check to ensure the DOM update still occurs immediately without animation, as shown in this helper function.

```javascript
/**
 * Navigates to a new view with a directional transition.
 * @param {Function} updateDOM - Callback to update the DOM state.
 * @param {string} direction - Either 'forward' or 'backward'.
 */
function navigate(updateDOM, direction) {
  // Feature detect for browsers that do not support View Transitions
  if (!document.startViewTransition) {
    updateDOM();
    return;
  }

  // Start transition with the specific navigation type
  document.startViewTransition({
    update: updateDOM,
    types: [direction] // Matches the CSS :active-view-transition-type() selectors
  });
}
```
